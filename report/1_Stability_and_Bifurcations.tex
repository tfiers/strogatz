\chapter{Stability of equilibrium points \& bifurcations}




\section{Simple population model}

The population model has in general two solutions (and hence two fixed points) for $\dot{N} = 0$ , namely
\[
N_1 = 0 \qq{and} N_2 = K \frac{\alpha - \beta}{\alpha}.
\]
The stability of these fixed points in function of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be summarised as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}} \toprule
Parameter region    &  Fixed points \\ \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}
{$\alpha < \beta$}  &  $N_1 = 0$: stable \\
                    &  $N_2 < 0$: unstable \\[1em]
\multirow{2}{*}
{$\alpha = \beta$}  &  $N_1 = N_2 = 0$: half-stable \\
                    &  (unstable for $N < 0$, stable for $N > 0$)  \\[1em]
\multirow{2}{*}
{$\alpha > \beta$}  &  $N_1 = 0$: unstable \\
                    &  $N_2 > 0$: stable \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The system thus undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at $\alpha = \beta$. Note that the fixed point $N_2 < 0$ is not meaningful in this model, as $N$ represents a non-negative population count.

For the given parameter values, $\alpha > \beta$. Using the above results, we therefore find an unstable fixed point $N_1 = 0$, and a stable fixed point $N_2 = K (\alpha - \beta)/\alpha = \num{4 023 913}$. As the population starts at $N > 0$, it will evolve towards $N_2$. The difference between $N(t)$ and $N(\infty) = N_2$ decays exponentially, as a Taylor approximation of $\dot{N}$ around $N_2$ can show.




\section{Gene control model}

For $r = 0$, the system equations become decoupled:
%
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= \frac{\alpha_1}{2} - x  \\
\dot{y} &= \frac{\alpha_2}{2} - y.
\end{align*}
%
We can therefore analyse them separately. It is clear that there is one fixed point, at $x^* = \alpha_1/2$ and $y^* = \alpha_2/2$. It is a globally stable attractor, as $\forall x < x^*,\ \dot{x} > 0$ and $\forall x > x^*,\ \dot{x} < 0$ (and analogously for $\dot{y}$ and $y^*$). The fixed point is thus an attracting star.

For $r \geq 0$ and $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 2$, the equilibrium equations become
%
\begin{align*}
x (1+y^r) &= 2 \\
y (1+x^r) &= 2.
\end{align*}
%
It is easily verified that $(1,1)$ is a solution and hence a fixed point. We have already shown that it is the only fixed point for $r = 0$. Plotting the gradient in phase space for different $r \in (0, 2)$ strongly suggests that it is also the only fixed point for nonzero $r < 2$ (at least for $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$). See e.g. \cref{fig:genes_r1} for $r = 1$. As a final piece of evidence, different trajectories simulated back in time all either tend towards $(\infty, \infty)$ or cross into forbidden $x < 0,\ y < 0$ territory.

% To analyse the stability of the $(1,1)$ fixed point, we study the behaviour of a small perturbation $\vb{u} = (x - 1, y - 1)$. To a first order approximation (Chapter 6 in Strogatz \cite{Strogatz1994}), this point will move through phase space according to:
% %
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:linear}
% \vb{\dot{u}} = A \ \vb{u},
% \end{equation}
% %
% where $A$ is the Jacobian of $(\dot{x}, \dot{y})$, evaluated in $(1, 1)$. The solution of \cref{eq:linear} is $\vb{u}(t) = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} \vb{v}_1 + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \vb{v}_2$, with $(\lambda_1, \vb{v}_1)$ and $(\lambda_2, \vb{v}_2)$ the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$.

To analyse the stability of the $(1,1)$ fixed point, we approximate $(\dot{x}, \dot{y})$ as a linear system around this point. The Jacobian of $(\dot{x}, \dot{y})$ evaluated in $(1,1)$ is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & -\frac{r}{2}  \\
-\frac{r}{2} & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
It has two distinct eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs:
%
\begin{align*}
\lambda_1 &= -\frac{r}{2} - 1   \qc \vb{v}_1 = (1,\ 1)  \\
\lambda_2 &= \frac{r}{2} - 1    \qc \vb{v}_2 = (-1,\ 1).
\end{align*}
%
For $0 \leq r < 2$, $\ \lambda_1 \in (-2, -1]$ and $\lambda_2 \in [-1, 0)$. Both eigenvalues are negative, and $(1,1)$ is therefore a stable node. Because $\lambda_1 < \lambda_2$, $\ \vb{v}_1 = (1,\ 1)$ is the fast eigendirection and $\vb{v}_2 = (-1,\ 1)$ is the slow eigendirection, as can be seen in \cref{fig:genes_r1}. (For $r = 0$, both eigenvalues are equal; i.e. $(1,1)$ is then a star node).

Based on phase space plots for different values of $r$, it seems that a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation occurs at $r = 2$. As the problem is symmetrical for $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$, this is expected (\citefull{Strogatz1994}).

\Cref{fig:gene_phases} shows the different types of phase portrait that occur as $r \ge 0$ is varied. \Cref{fig:gene_bifurc} sketches the bifurcation diagram.

(For the intermediate case between $r = 0$ and $r = 2$, see \cref{fig:genes_r1}).\emph{Middle}: $r = 2$. There is still only one fixed point. Because we are exactly at the bifurcation point, the approach to the fixed point occurs very slowly (i.e. no longer exponentially fast). This is known as critical slowing down. \emph{Right}: $r = 3$. There are three fixed points: a saddle point at $(1,1)$, and two attracting nodes (mirror symmetric around $y = x$).}

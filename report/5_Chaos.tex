\section{Lyapunov exponents of the Lorenz equations}
\label{sec:lorenz}

The idea of the numeric algorithm to find Lyapunov exponents is twofold. First, we use the following definition of the Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_k$ for $k = 1 \tdots n$. A $n$-dimensional sphere of infinitesimal radius $r$ surrounding the starting point of a trajectory will get stretched out over time as it follows the point along the trajectory. At time $t$, the sphere will be an ellipsoid whose principal axes have length $r_k(t) = r e^{\lambda_k t}$. When we then have an estimate for these $r_k(t)$, we can find the Lyapunov exponents as $\lambda_k = \frac{1}{t} \log{\frac{r_k(t)}{r}}$

Then, the principal axes length $r_k(t)$ are found numerically as follows. The algorithm used in this exercise integrates both an initial phase point and the spatial gradient of the phase point along the trajectory over fixed time steps \texttt{st}, via the simplest first order Euler method. Next, an orthogonal basis is sought for the new spatial gradient, via the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The cumulative sum of logarithms of the Gram-Schmidt scaling factors divided by the total time elapsed is then the estimate of the Lyapunov exponent. This integration-orthogonalisation loop is repeated for a given number of iterations \texttt{kkmax}.

When the time step is too large (e.g. \texttt{st = 0.1} here), the exponents diverge. When it is too small on the other hand (\texttt{st = 0.001} here), the convergence is extremely slow. Even for a balanced time step (like \texttt{st = 0.01} here), enough iterations need to be taken yield a decent result (e.g. \texttt{kkmax > 400} here; see \cref{fig:LE_Lorenz}). The initial phase point also influences the results. A different phase point as in \cref{fig:LE_Lorenz} (namely $(6,6,6)$) yields better estimates, for example (resulting exponents $0.89, -0.04, $ and $-14$).

Interestingly, using a more advanced ODE solver (like a higher order Runge-Kutta method) or orthogonalisation algorithm (like a singular value decompostion via the QR-algorithm) yields markably worse results.

\section{Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model}

The system behaves chaotically in random burst mode (\cref{fig:neuron}, top): even the tiniest perturbation to the initial phase point renders $x(t)$eventually unpredictable. The burst generation mode is not chaotic: even relatively large perturbations do not qualitatively change the phase space trajectories (\cref{fig:neuron}, bottom).

\section{Chua's circuit}

A simulation of the Chua circuit displays chaotic behaviour (\cref{fig:chua}). Estimating the Lyapunov exponents according to the method of \cref{sec:lorenz} confirms this: the largest exponent $\approx 0.16 > 0$ (\cref{fig:LE_chua}).

\chapter{Study of a predator-prey model}



We study the system

\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= x (x-a) (1-x) - bxy  \\
\dot{y} &= xy - cy - d,
\end{align*}

with $a = 0.1$ and $b = 1.5$. The following could be an ecological interpretation of this system as a predator-prey model:

The $-d$ term represents a constant decline of species $y$; This would correspond to a linear decrease in $y$ over time, with slope $d$, if this was the only term present. Maybe an environmental agency eliminates a fixed number $d$ of $y$-type animals every time period, to keep the ecosystem balanced.

The $-cy$ term represents a proportional pressure on $y$, corresponding to an exponential decline of $y$ over time with time constant $1/c$ (i.e. faster decline for larger $c$). There might be a fixed amount of resources available for the $y$ species. Then, a larger number of $y$ animals will result in a proportionally smaller amount of resources per animal.

The $xy$ term represents a growth of $y$ that is both proportional to the other species and to itself. For constant $x$, this would correspond to exponential growth of $y$ with time constant $1/x$ (i.e. faster growth for more $x$). $y$ could be a multiplying parasite, and $x$ could be its host.

The $-bxy$ term represents a decline of the $x$ species proportional to both itself and to the other species $y$. For constant $y$, this would correspond to an exponential decline of $x$ with time constant $1/(by)$. The $y$ parasite might be pathological for $x$. Both more parasites $y$ and more hosts $x$ yield a higher probability of transmitting the parasite between hosts.

Finally, the $x (1-x)$ factor of the first term describes logistic growth (i.e. exponential growth from the origin, which switches halfway to exponential decay up to a carrying capacity -- which is $1$ in this case). This is a common model for constrained species growth. The $(x-a)$ multiplier has the effect that the growth does not start until $x$ reaches $a$: for $x < a$, the species will decline instead of grow. This could model the fact that more than a few individuals are necessary for succesful long-term reproduction.

Simulating the system for $y = 0$ confirms the predictions made above for the standalone behaviour of $x(t)$ (\cref{fig:time_sim}): logistic growth above the threshold $a$, and decay to zero below this threshold.

Note the stable fixed points at $0$ and at the carrying capacity $1$, and the unstable fixed point at $a = 0.1$.}

The system has four fixed points for $d = 0$. Three of these lie on the $x$-axis. They are listed in \cref{tab:fpx}, together with the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Jacobian in these points. The fourth fixed points has coordinates $(c,\ (c-a)(1-c)/b)$, and the eigenstructure of its Jacobian is rather more.. complex. The trace $\tau$ and the determinant $\Delta$ have simpler analytical expressions however: $\tau = c(1+a-2c)$ and $\Delta = c(c-a)(1-c)$. The following paragraphs describe the topological structure near these four fixed points.

$(0,\ 0)$ is an attractor node. In the common case that $c > a = 0.1$, the $x$-axis is the slow eigendirection. When $c < a$, the $y$-axis is the slow eigendirection.

$(a,\ 0)$ is a saddle when $c > a$. Its stable manifold is then the $x$-axis, and its unstable manifold is locally spanned by $(ab/(c-a^2),\ 1)$, which is an upwards pointing vector, rotated slightly right. When $c < a$, both dimensions are unstable, and $(a,\ 0)$ is then a repellor node. For $c > a^2$, the slow eigendirection is $(ab/(c-a^2),\ 1)$. For $c < a^2$, the $x$-axis is the slow eigendirection.

$(1,\ 0)$ is a saddle when $c < 1$. With $a = 0.1$, the stable manifold is the $x$-axis, and the unstable manifold is locally spanned by $(-b/(2-c-a),\ 1)$, which is an upwards pointing vector, rotated slightly \emph{left}. When $c > 1$, both dimensions become stable, and $(1,\ 0)$ is then an attracting node. Because $c < 1.5$ in this exercise, the slow eigendirection is $(-b/(2-c-a),\ 1)$.

Finally,

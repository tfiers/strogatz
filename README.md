# Strogatz

Notebooks, code, and report for my 
[uni course](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H0S11AE.htm)
on non-linear dynamical systems.

(Repository named after Steven Strogatz, the mathematician that wrote
[this great book](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering),
on which the course is based).
